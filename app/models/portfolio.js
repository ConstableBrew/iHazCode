			body:	"<p>I have been fortunate in having a passion that translates into a day job. I am equally entertained by playing games with friends or solving a coding challenge.</p><p>I keep up with science news, but tend to be the last to hear about anything else going on. I love reading novels. Mostly fantasy, but also some horror and scifi. I am currently finishing the Game of Thrones series and will be reading Disc world next.</p><p>I bike, run, rock climb, and CrossFit. I also eat lots of chocolate.</p>"
