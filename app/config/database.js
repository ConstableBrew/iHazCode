I keep up with science news, but tend to be the last to hear about anything else going on. I love reading novels. Mostly fantasy, but also some horror and scifi. I am currently finishing the Game of Thrones series and will be reading more Disc world next. My favorite podcasts are Skeptics Guide to the Universe, This Week in Virology, and Philosophize This. I bike, run, rock climb, fence, and CrossFit. I also eat lots of chocolate.",
